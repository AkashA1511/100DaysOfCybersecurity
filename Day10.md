## Day 10 - Learning CCNA's CLI (Command Line Interface)

Today, I learned about the Command Line Interface (CLI) commands used in Cisco's CCNA certification. The CLI is essential for configuring and managing Cisco devices, such as routers and switches. Here are some key takeaways:

### Key Topics:
- Basic CLI Navigation
- Common CLI Commands
  - `show running-config`: Displays the current configuration in use by the device.
  - `show startup-config`: Displays the configuration that will be used upon next reboot.
  - `configure terminal`: Enters global configuration mode.
  - `interface [type] [number]`: Enters interface configuration mode.
  - `enable`: Enters privileged EXEC mode.
  - `exit`: Exits the current configuration mode or session.
  - `copy running-config startup-config`: Saves the current configuration to the startup configuration.
  - `reload`: Reboots the device.
  - `show ip interface brief`: Displays a summary of IP information for all interfaces.## Day 10 - Learning CCNA's CLI (Command Line Interface)
