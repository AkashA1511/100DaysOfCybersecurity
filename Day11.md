## Day 11 - Authentication Bypass
**TryHackMe Lab: [Authentication Bypass](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/authenticationbypass)**

Today, I solved the TryHackMe room on Authentication Bypass. This lab focused on learning how to defeat login mechanisms and other authentication processes to gain unauthorized access.

### Key Topics:
- Understanding Authentication Bypass Techniques
- Common Vulnerabilities Leading to Authentication Bypass
- Practical Examples of Authentication Bypass

### Summary:
I learned how to identify and exploit weaknesses in authentication systems. This knowledge is crucial for both offensive and defensive security, enabling me to understand how attackers might gain unauthorized access and how to protect against such attacks.

## IDOR

**TryHackMe Lab: [IDOR](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/idor)**
After solving the Authentication Bypass lab, I moved on to the TryHackMe lab on IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References). This lab focused on identifying and exploiting IDOR vulnerabilities in web applications to gain access to unauthorized data.

### Key Topics:
- Understanding IDOR Vulnerabilities
- Techniques to Identify and Exploit IDOR
- Practical Examples of IDOR Exploitation

### Summary:
I learned how attackers can exploit IDOR vulnerabilities to access data they shouldn't have permission to view. This knowledge is essential for securing web applications by ensuring that proper access controls are in place.
