## Day 11 - Authentication Bypass
**TryHackMe Lab: [Authentication Bypass](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/authenticationbypass)**

Today, I solved the TryHackMe room on Authentication Bypass. This lab focused on learning how to defeat login mechanisms and other authentication processes to gain unauthorized access.

### Key Topics:
- Understanding Authentication Bypass Techniques
- Common Vulnerabilities Leading to Authentication Bypass
- Practical Examples of Authentication Bypass

### Summary:
I learned how to identify and exploit weaknesses in authentication systems. This knowledge is crucial for both offensive and defensive security, enabling me to understand how attackers might gain unauthorized access and how to protect against such attacks.

## IDOR

**TryHackMe Lab: [IDOR](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/idor)**
After solving the Authentication Bypass lab, I moved on to the TryHackMe lab on IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References). This lab focused on identifying and exploiting IDOR vulnerabilities in web applications to gain access to unauthorized data.

### Key Topics:
- Understanding IDOR Vulnerabilities
- Techniques to Identify and Exploit IDOR
- Practical Examples of IDOR Exploitation

### Summary:
I learned how attackers can exploit IDOR vulnerabilities to access data they shouldn't have permission to view. This knowledge is essential for securing web applications by ensuring that proper access controls are in place.


## Bug Bounty and Hack The Box

### Bug Bounty:
I have started learning about Bug Bounty programs and created an account on Hack The Box. I solved an introductory room in their Academy section. Although there was an issue with using a US VPN, I plan to start the Bug Hunter Path soon.

### Tools:
I have also started learning about NMAP and FFUF tools, which are essential for Bug Hunting. Soon, I will practice hands-on with these tools on some demo labs to enhance my skills.

#### NMAP:
NMAP (Network Mapper) is a powerful tool used for network discovery and security auditing. It is commonly used for:
- Host discovery
- Port scanning
- Service enumeration
- OS detection

#### FFUF:
FFUF (Fuzz Faster U Fool) is a tool used for web fuzzing. It helps in discovering hidden files, directories, and parameters in web applications. It is commonly used for:
- Content discovery
- Parameter fuzzing
- Brute-forcing web directories and files

### Summary:
- Created an account on Hack The Box
- Solved an introductory room in Hack The Box Academy
- Learned about Bug Bounty programs
- Started learning NMAP and FFUF tools for Bug Hunting
- Plan to practice hands-on with NMAP and FFUF tools on demo labs
