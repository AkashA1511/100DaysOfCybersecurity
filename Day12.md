## Day 12 - File Inclusion

**TryHackMe Lab: [File Inclusion](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/fileinc)**
Today, I solved the TryHackMe lab on File Inclusion. This lab introduces file inclusion vulnerabilities, including Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote File Inclusion (RFI), and directory traversal.

### Key Topics:
- Understanding File Inclusion Vulnerabilities
- Local File Inclusion (LFI)
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
- Directory Traversal Techniques
- I was Unable to solved challange in that room so I read Walkthrough on medium

### Summary:
I learned about different types of file inclusion vulnerabilities and how attackers can exploit them to read sensitive files or execute arbitrary code on the server. This knowledge is crucial for securing web applications by validating and sanitizing file paths and inputs.
