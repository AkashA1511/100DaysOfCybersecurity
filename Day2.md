# Day 2 - TryHackMe Labs, Cybersecurity Job Roles, and Python Practice

**Date:** 2024-07-24

## Summary
Today, I worked on three TryHackMe labs related to Offensive and Defensive Security, explored different job roles in cybersecurity with a focus on penetration testing and red teaming, solved some math quizzes in Python to enhance my skills, and made progress on my blockchain freelance project.

## Detailed Notes

### TryHackMe Labs
I completed the following labs on TryHackMe:
- [Offensive Security](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/introtooffensivesecurity): Focused on attacking and exploiting vulnerabilities.
- [Defensive Security](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/defensivesecurity): Concentrated on defending against attacks and securing systems.
- [Different Job Roles in Cybersecurity](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/careersincyber): Learned about various roles within the field, including penetration testers and red teamers.

**Key Takeaway:**
Penetration testing and red teaming fascinate me the most, and I plan to focus on the offensive side of cybersecurity moving forward.

### Python Practice
I solved math quizzes in Python to improve my programming skills and understanding of the language.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- Basic Python operations
- Problem-solving with Python

### Blockchain Freelance Project
I continued working on my blockchain freelance project, which has limited the time available for other activities. I plan to dedicate more time to cybersecurity after August 15, when my college starts.

### Write-ups
Considering the value of documentation and knowledge sharing in cybersecurity, I'm contemplating starting to write detailed write-ups for each lab and exercise I complete. This practice will not only help solidify my understanding but also contribute to the community by providing insights and solutions.

## Reflections
Today was productive, with a good mix of learning and practical work. I gained valuable insights from the TryHackMe labs and reinforced my Python skills with math quizzes. Although my blockchain project has been demanding, Iâ€™m excited to dive deeper into cybersecurity once my college schedule allows. 

Looking forward to more progress on Day 3!
