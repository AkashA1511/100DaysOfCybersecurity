# Day 3 - Penetration Testing Fundamentals and Python Network Programming

**Date:** 2024-07-25

## Summary
Today, I solved the "Penetration Testing Fundamentals" room on TryHackMe, started reading a Python book focused on network programming, and continued working on my blockchain freelance project.

## Detailed Notes

### TryHackMe Lab: Penetration Testing Fundamentals
I completed the [Penetration Testing Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/pentestingfundamentals) room on TryHackMe, which covered the essential stages of penetration testing:

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- **Information Gathering:** Collecting data about the target system.
- **Enumeration/Scanning:** Identifying web servers that are vulnerable.
- **Exploitation:** Exploring system logic and discovering new applications.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Finding ways to gain higher-level access within the system.
- **Post-exploitation:** 
  - Gathering additional information.
  - Covering tracks.
  - Reporting findings.

### Python Network Programming
I started reading "Python Network Programming Cookbook" by Kathiravelu P. and Sarker F. Today, I learned the basics of sockets, IPv4, and simple client/server programming.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- Printing your machine's name and IPv4 address.
- Retrieving a remote machine's IP address.
- Converting an IPv4 address to different formats.
- Finding a service name given the port and protocol.
- Setting and getting the default socket timeout.
- Handling socket errors gracefully.
- Modifying a socket's send/receive buffer size.
- Changing a socket to the blocking/non-blocking mode.
- Reusing socket addresses.
- Printing the current time from the internet time server.
- Writing a simple TCP and UDP echo client/server application.

### Blockchain Freelance Project
I made progress on my blockchain freelance project. This project is taking a significant portion of my time, but I am balancing it with my cybersecurity learning.

## Reflections
Today was a mix of learning and practical application. The TryHackMe lab provided a solid foundation in penetration testing, and the Python book helped me understand network programming basics. Although I'm busy with my freelance project, I'm looking forward to diving deeper into cybersecurity topics.

Next, I plan to solve the Linux Fundamentals room on TryHackMe and continue improving my Python skills by solving DSA questions.

Looking forward to more progress on Day 4!
