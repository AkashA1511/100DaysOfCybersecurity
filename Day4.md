# Day 4 - Python Basics, Networking, and Cybersecurity Documentaries

**Date:** 2024-07-26

## Summary
Today, I completed the Python Basics lab on TryHackMe, started learning about networking through CCNA tutorials, and explored cybersecurity documentaries and hacker interviews. Additionally, I learned about telephone phreaking.

## Detailed Notes

### TryHackMe Lab: Python Basics
I solved the [Python Basics](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/pythonbasics) lab on TryHackMe.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- Python syntax and structure.
- Data types and variables.
- Control flow statements (if-else, loops).
- Functions and modules.
- Basic input/output operations.

### Networking CCNA
I started learning about networking fundamentals from the CCNA series by Jeremy's IT Lab on YouTube.

**Topics Covered:**
- Introduction to networking.
- Basics of IP addressing and subnetting.
- Understanding network devices and their roles.

### Cybersecurity Documentaries and Hacker Interviews
I watched several documentaries about the dark web and interviews with hackers, which provided valuable insights into the hacker mindset and real-world cybersecurity challenges.

### Telephone Phreaking
I also delved into the history and techniques of telephone phreaking, a form of hacking that involves exploiting the telephone network.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- The origins and evolution of telephone phreaking.
- Techniques used by phreakers to manipulate the phone system.
- Notable figures and events in the history of phreaking.

## Reflections
Today was an enriching mix of practical learning and theoretical knowledge. The Python Basics lab helped solidify my understanding of Python, and the CCNA tutorials provided a strong foundation in networking. Watching documentaries and learning about telephone phreaking added a historical perspective to my cybersecurity journey.

Looking forward to more progress on Day 5!
