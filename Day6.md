# Day 6 - Digital Forensics and Introduction to Web Security

**Date:** 2024-07-28

## Summary
Today, I completed the Digital Forensics room on TryHackMe, solved some Leetcode questions, and started learning about PortSwigger and OWASP top 10.

## Detailed Notes

### Digital Forensics
I solved the [Digital Forensics](https://tryhackme.com/room/introdigitalforensics) room on TryHackMe.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- Introduction to digital forensics
- Types of digital evidence
- Tools and techniques used in digital forensics
- Analyzing digital evidence

### Leetcode Practice
I also spent time solving coding questions on Leetcode to improve my problem-solving skills and strengthen my programming knowledge.

### Web Security: PortSwigger and OWASP Top 10
Starting from today, I am diving into web security topics, focusing on PortSwigger's labs and the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities.

**Goals:**
- Understand and exploit common web vulnerabilities
- Learn how to secure web applications
- Gain hands-on experience with PortSwigger's labs

## Reflections
Today was productive with a mix of digital forensics and coding practice. I'm excited to delve into web security topics and improve my understanding of web vulnerabilities and their mitigations. Looking forward to learning more on Day 7!
